Geez Rick, this challenge kinda pissed me off.

Yea Morty, I feel you. It was like right there, right there in front our faces Morty. In front of our damn faces!!

## 1. Enumeration

Alright, first things first, lets kick off some scans while we browse the web page.

`nikto -h http://142.93.45.112:32113`

`dirb http://142.93.45.112:32113 -r`

While those were running, I went ahead and started browsing the page.

![landing page](../images/bii_main.png "landing page")

At first it appeared as though there was nothing too special about the site. After refreshing it, I noticed the number changed under the picture of the two interdimensional travelers.

![landing page new](../images/bii_main2.png "landing page new")

So this lets me know the page is not necessarily static, but is being dynamically generated somehow. Also, my scans were taking forever and nothing was really returning, so I stopped those.

Lets turn to our trusty developer tools via Firefox and see if we can get anything new from there.

Well why dont ya look at that, looks like we might have something at `/debug`

![possible lead](../images/bii_debug.png "possible lead")

Also noticed the response from the server...

![maybe flask](../images/bii_flask.png "maybe flask")

So it looks like we have some Flask involved, and after navigating to `http://142.93.45.112:32113/debug/`, Flask is confirmed. With the confirmation of Flask runnin, it  just lets us know its a Python based web server.

![debug](../images/bii_debug2.png "debug")

## 2. Exploiting Python Exec

First thing that stands out after reviewing the debug page is in the function `calc`.

```
def calc(recipe):
  global garage
  garage = {}
  try: exec(recipe, garage)
  except: pass
```
## 5. Conclusion
